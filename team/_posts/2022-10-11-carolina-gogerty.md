I am a scientific researcher and ASU alumna with degrees in Biology (M.S.), Biological Sciences (B.S.), and Music (B.A.), alongside my current focus on biophysics research and laboratory management. The research I conducted during my master's degree program concentrated on protein signaling pathways involved in a type of programmed cell death called necroptosis. I also have experience with high-throughput microbiology and molecular biology methods and robotics. My interests involve using biotechnology tools and genetic analysis to approach questions regarding the ability of bacteria to sense and respond to their environments, and I am excited to play a role in advancing biophysics research.
