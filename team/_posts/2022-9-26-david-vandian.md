Hello! I am an undergraduate in 15th grade taking classes in biotechnology, physics, and linguistics. My life's goal is to do good science and share my findings, focusing on high-quality scientific and literary output. Since my interests lie in the intersection of biology and physics, I decided to learn both. The research I am focusing on investigates how chemical interactions in bacteria affect their motion. I am very grateful for the chance to contribute to the literature in any way, since my career is yet immature.
