I am a current undergraduate student, majoring in biochemistry at Barrett, The Honors College. I am interested in research pertaining to the intersection of computational modeling and biological systems. I believe that through models, the biological world can be better understood, allowing for insight into novel pathways and interactions. As such, I hope, through experimentation and the collecting and use of data, to investigate the mechanisms of motility and stimuli perception within microorganisms.
