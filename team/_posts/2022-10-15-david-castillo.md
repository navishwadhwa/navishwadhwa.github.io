I'm a microbiologist who has been involved to comprehend how cells move and how energy is transferred. Over the course of my career, I have been involved in the study of a number of bacterial molecular nanomotors, including the type IV pili, the ATP synthase, and of course the bacterial flagella motor of different species. Despite the enormous body of knowledge that has been accumulated over the course of more than 50 years of discovery and study in the field, I believe the flagellar motor to be one of the most intricate and complex prokaryotic organelles that can continue surprising us for many more decades. It is undoubtedly an excellent model for comprehending core fundaments regarding biological evolution of complex systems at the nanoscale.
