I'm a microbiologist interested in understanding how cells move and utilize energy. Throughout my career, I researched molecular nanomotors including the type IV pili, ATP synthase and the flagellar motor of different bacterial species. Despite extensive years of research, I find the flagellar motor to be one of the most intricate and complex prokaryotic structures. It is an excellent model for comprehending core concepts regarding the evolution of complex systems at the nanoscale level.
