I'm a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. in Physics with a focus on biophysics. I'm deeply intrigued by the way physics interacts with the living world, and I'm particularly interested in experimental research to explore this connection. My aim is to unravel how the fundamental principles of physics are linked to the workings of living organisms, and I'm excited to contribute to both fields as I embark on this journey.
