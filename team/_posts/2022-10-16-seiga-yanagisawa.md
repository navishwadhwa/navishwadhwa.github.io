I'm a postdoctoral researcher with a background in molecular biology. As a Ph.D. student, I worked on single-molecule measurement of the rotation of the ATP synthase. I want to apply what I learned in my Ph.D to study the bacterial flagellar motor which is another proton gradient-driven molecular motor.
