I am a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Wadhwa's lab. During my PhD, I developed techniques for cell separation and manipulation using inertial and oscillatory microfluidics. I am interested in learning how bacteria interact with their physical environment and designing microfluidic tools to manipulate and study bacterial behavior in confined spaces.
