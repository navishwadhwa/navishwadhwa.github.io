I am Shajeda Begum, a PhD student in physics at Arizona State University with a deep passion for biophysics. My research focuses on swimming assays and bacterial motility, particularly studying the behavior of E. coli mutants. Through my work, I aim to contribute valuable insights into the complex mechanisms governing bacterial movement and how these processes can be harnessed for broader scientific and societal applications.
