I am a Postdoctoral fellow with a PhD in molecular biology and biochemistry. In my doctoral research, I examined the role of cytoskeletal proteins in the maintenance of cell shape and motility in cell wall-less bacteria. Building on the knowledge I gained from my previous training, I am now eager to expand my understanding by investigating motility systems in different bacterial species.
