<!-- Ever since I learnt classical mechanics in high school, I have been amazed by the awesome power of Newton's laws and how much of the world can be understood by using different versions of these physical laws.  -->
My scientific interests lie in understanding the interaction between living systems and the mechanical world they inhabit. How do forces regulate the input-output function of mechano-chemical pathways? How do living organisms use this regulation to collect information from their surroundings? Throughout my career, I have undertaken a broad exploration of the interplay between mechanics and biology in diverse organisms, such as bacteria, unicellular and multicellular plankton, and insects. My current and future research builds on this experience and perspective to take a deep dive into the mechanical lives of bacteria.
