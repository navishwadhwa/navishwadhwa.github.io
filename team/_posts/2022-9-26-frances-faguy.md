Next stop: Graduate Student, Northern Arizona University

I am a student in Barrett, the Honors College, majoring in Microbiology with a minor in Philosophy. I plan to graduate in 2024 and I am interested in bacterial motility and the biochemical processes involved in bacterial growth, as well as the development of biofilms. I study the philosophy of science and as I become more acquainted with the process of scientific inquiry, I hope to produce research with a meaningful response to a specific question.
