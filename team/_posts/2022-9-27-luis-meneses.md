I am an undergraduate student majoring in bioscience with a concentration in neurobiology, physiology, and behavior. I am interested in understanding human disease through genetic testing and protein modeling. From my research, I aim to investigate mechanomicrobiology from a genetic perspective, by identifying the proteins and genes that are responsive to the physical cues that allow microorganisms to sense their mechanical environment.
