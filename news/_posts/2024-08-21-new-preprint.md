Our newest preprint describes a novel and interesting form of bacterial surface motility in *E. coli* and *Salmonella*. In a colloboration with the Blair Lab at the University of Utah, we show flagellar propulsion is dispensable for surface motility of these species, and, instead, movement is driven by osmotic flows and fermentation. Check out the preprint on [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.21.609010){:target="_blank"}.
