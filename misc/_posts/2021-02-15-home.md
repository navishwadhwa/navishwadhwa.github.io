**The Wadhwa lab** is a part of the [Center for Biological Physics](https://cbp.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the [Biodesign Center for Mechanisms of Evolution](https://biodesign.asu.edu/research/centers/mechanisms-evolution){:target="_blank"} at Arizona State University. We seek to understand the mechanical interactions between bacterial cells and their environment as well as the intracellular signaling processes that enable bacteria to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli.
