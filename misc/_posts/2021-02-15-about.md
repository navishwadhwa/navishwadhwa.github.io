# About this site

This website is adapted from an excellent open-source template from the [Drummond Lab](http://drummondlab.org/){:target="_blank"}. You are welcome to use or repupose my codes to build your own website, but if you do, I'd highly appreciate attribution and a link back [here](https://navishwadhwa.github.io/){:target="_blank"} in your 'about' page. The source code is available in this [Github repository](https://github.com/navishwadhwa/navishwadhwa.github.io){:target="_blank"}. You will need [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com){:target="_blank"} to build the site, and you can host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. Instructions on how to update the content of the site and make other changed can be found in the file instructions.md.
