## Mechanobiology of Bacteria

Our lab investigates the critical role that physical forces play in bacterial behavior, focusing on how mechanosensing enables bacteria to respond and adapt to their environments. Once thought to be regulated solely by biochemical interactions, bacterial processes like swarming, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis are now understood to be deeply influenced by mechanical cues. This emerging field, known as [mechanomicrobiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-019-0314-2){:target="_blank"}, explores how bacteria detect and react to surfaces, fluid flows, and osmotic stress, ultimately enhancing their ability to survive in diverse and challenging environments.

# The Mechanics of the Flagellar Motor
The bacterial flagellar motor is a molecular machine essential for swimming motility and is a central focus of our work. We are investigating how this motor adapts to changes in mechanical load, using a combination of computational modeling and experimental approaches to uncover the structural basis of its mechanosensitivity. Additionally, we are exploring how the motor's geometry influences its ability to generate torque, providing deeper insights into the fundamental mechanics of this remarkable biological system.
# Flagella as Mechanosensors
Another key focus of our research is understanding how bacterial flagella function not only as propellers but also as mechanosensors. During the early stages of biofilm formation, bacterial cells transition from a planktonic to a sessile state upon detecting surface contact. We are exploring the molecular mechanisms behind this surface detection, focusing on how the flagellar motor responds to mechanical load and triggers cellular signaling pathways that drive behavioral changes.
# Bacterial Sensing of Fluid Flows
Bacteria live in fluid environments and must constantly sense and adapt to hydrodynamic signals. Our lab uses microfluidic systems and quantitative imaging to investigate how single bacterial cells detect and respond to the flow of fluids in their surroundings. This research aims to reveal new insights into bacterial motility and their ability to navigate complex environments.
# Osmotic Stress Response
Osmotic stress is a common mechanical challenge for bacteria, yet little is known about how they sense and respond to sudden increases in external osmolarity. We study bacterial responses to rapid osmotic shocks at a single-cell level, using high-resolution techniques to measure their immediate physiological changes. This work expands our understanding of bacterial adaptation to mechanical stress and the protective mechanisms they employ under fluctuating environmental conditions.
# Tools and Techniques
Our research combines cutting-edge techniques in single-cell biophysics, quantitative microscopy, and high-throughput genetics to manipulate and observe bacterial cells at the microscale. We have developed tools like electrorotation to apply mechanical forces to single bacteria, allowing us to study the dynamic response of their molecular machinery. By applying multidisciplinary approaches, we aim to unlock new insights into how bacteria integrate physical signals with biochemical pathways, ultimately shaping their behavior in natural environments and during infections.
